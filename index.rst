**About AgBase**
================

`AgBase <https://agbase.arizona.edu/>`_ is a curated, open-source, Web-accessible resource for functional analysis of agricultural plant and animal gene products. Our long-term goal is to serve the needs of the agricultural research communities by facilitating post-genome biology for agriculture researchers and for those researchers primarily using agricultural species as biomedical models. 

We use controlled vocabularies developed by the `Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium <http://www.geneontology.org/>`_ to describe molecular function, biological process, and cellular component for genes and gene products in agricultural species. For more information about the AgBase database please visit our `Educational Resources <https://agbase.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/education.cgi>`_ page or refer to our `AgBase publications <https://agbase.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/cite.pl>`_ . 

AgBase will also accept annotations from any interested party in the research communities. AgBase develops freely available tools for functional analysis, including tools for using GO. We appreciate any and all questions, comments, and suggestions. Please send us your ideas about how to make AgBase more useful for you.
