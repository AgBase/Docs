**Intro**
==========

- KEGG Orthology Based Annotation System (KOBAS) is a standalone Python application.
- Consists of two modules:
    1. annotate--Assigns appropriate KO terms for queried sequences based on a similarity search.
    2. identify--Discovers enriched KO terms among the annotation results by frequency of pathways or statistical significance of pathways. 



**Where to Find KOBAS** 
=======================

KOBAS is provided as a Docker container for use on the command line and as a group of apps in the CyVerse Discovery Environment.

**Help and Usage Statement**
============================
On the command line the following help statement can be displayed with the option '-h'.

.. code-block:: none

    
    Options:
    [-h prints this help statement]
